Snake Game



This is my project about the very simple but yet very fun and addicting, Snake. This is a very good game to play whenever you are bored and are trying to burn a bit of time. It's a very simple game that only requires 4 buttons! All you as the gamer have to do is move the snake either up,donw,left,or right. The main goal of this game is to move your snake around and collects apples to grow your snake. The more apples you collect the bigger you get and the harder the game gets, you will need some sort of reaction time so you don't lose. The only ways to lose is either leading your snake out of bounds or running into yourself. There isn't really much to it! The main thing that is being used to program and run this game is Javascript.

I am new to coding there is a few bugs that I am trying to resolve which is a replay button for when the game is finished. At the moment you have to refresh  the page to play again but I am working to fix that. Also this isn't really much of a bug but I also trying to add a little score counter at the bottom to see how much score you have!
